# Machine Learning Design Patterns

This repository contains code examples and explanations for popular design patterns implemented in Python.

## Available Design Patterns

Explore the documentation for each design pattern by clicking the links below:

- [**Factory Design Pattern**](./factory_pattern.md)  
  A creational pattern used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

- [**Strategy Design Pattern**](./strategy_pattern.md)  
  A behavioral pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime from a family of algorithms.

- [**Template Design Pattern**](./template_pattern.md)  
  A behavioral pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm, allowing subclasses to redefine specific steps.

## Code Implementations

You can find the Python code implementations of the design patterns here:
