## Template Design Pattern 

The Template Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern commonly used in software development, including machine learning (ML) pipelines. It allows for defining the skeleton of an algorithm or a process in a base class, where the specific steps can be modified or defined in subclasses without altering the overall structure.

### Why Use the Template Design Pattern in ML:

1 **Modularity**: The pattern promotes modular code, where specific steps of the ML process can be changed without affecting the overall pipeline. For instance, you can easily swap out a preprocessing technique, loss function, or evaluation metric.

2. **Maintainability**: As the common structure is centralized in the base class, changes in the workflow (e.g., introducing a new logging step) can be made in one place, making the system easier to maintain.

3. **Flexibility**: It provides flexibility by enabling developers to define fixed steps (such as data loading, logging, etc.) while allowing customization where needed (e.g., different model architectures or training strategies).


### Real-world Use Case

**Problem**: In a typical ML pipeline, the core steps of the workflow are:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing data.
2. Model Training: Training the model with the given dataset.
3. Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance.
4. Post-Processing: Additional analysis or model persistence.

However, each ML model may have different preprocessing techniques, training procedures, and evaluation metrics. For example, a neural network may require different preprocessing steps (e.g., scaling the data), while decision trees may not. Similarly, evaluation metrics may differ based on the model's goals.


**Solution**: The Template Design Pattern provides a structure for these shared tasks while allowing customization in specific steps for each model. Hereâ€™s how it works:

Define an abstract class MLModelTemplate that provides a "template method" (i.e., the structure of the workflow) for the ML process. The abstract class implements the general workflow steps, while allowing subclasses to define the specific implementation of each step.

Concrete subclasses (e.g., RandomForestModel, NeuralNetworkModel) will implement model-specific details for each step while following the general process defined by the template.
